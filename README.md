# Greener-Towns
A multiplayer game where players compete to have a greener virtual city

The players draw cards from a deck of cards containing the images of a
city or an activity. The cards having the city can only be connected where they have roads,
i.e. you can connect road links of one card to the road link of another card. Each card has a
greenery in square feet (calculation of greenery explained later), in the end whoever has
more greenery wins the game. Both players take turns to draw cards from the same deck
which has 30 cards, 24 are city cards and 6 are activity cards. The game ends when all cards
are used up. The players have an option to use their cards later.
